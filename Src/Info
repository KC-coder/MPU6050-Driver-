 ************************ application programs ******************************** 
 				
 					For testing the driver functions
 								&
 And to act as  example program for the user to understand driver & sensor 
 
 

1 ) SelfTest.c 

In this we perform the self test on the sensor 
and use  16x02 display in 4/8 line mode to display its value

2) AccelOnly 

In this we perform the self test on the sensor then only turn on the 
accelerometer sensor of the MPU to calibrate it we don't use the FIFO  
and use  16x02 display in 4/8 line mode to display its value.

3)GyroOnly
In this we perform the self test on the sensor then only turn on the 
Gyro sensor of the MPU to calibrate it we don't use the FIFO  
and use  16x02 display in 4/8 line mode to display its value.

4)AccelGyro

In this we perform the self test on the sensor then y turn on the accel & 
Gyro sensor of the MPU to calibrate it we don't use the FIFO  
and use  16x02 display in 4/8 line mode to display its value.

4)AccelGyro

In this we perform the self test on the sensor then we turn on the accel & 
Gyro sensor of the MPU to calibrate it with FIFO   
and use  16x02 display in 4/8 line mode to display its value.

5) Complete sensor

In this we perform the self test on the sensor then turn on the accel, temp & 
Gyro sensor of the MPU to calibrate it without FIFO   
and use  16x02 display in 4/8 line mode to display its value.

6) Complete sensor with FIFO 

In this we perform the self test on the sensor then turn on the accel, temp & 
Gyro sensor of the MPU to calibrate it without FIFO   
and use  16x02 display in 4/8 line mode to display its value.

7)Complete sensor in interrupt mode 

8) complete sensor with interrupt functionality , with temp and FIFO

9) make level check device using this sensor

10) globe of LED application 

11) servo movement with the sensor

12) test sensor slave functions

13) To be decided
